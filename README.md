This project is a minimal Single Page Application created with [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which can calculate hashes (digests) of a given
text, using an algorithm selected by the user. The calculations run on the client.
